// GL-SFT1200 running 4.3.28: the firmware silently renumbers every bind into the new
// subnet, preserving host parts. 192.168.2.10 became 192.168.8.10 across 27
// reservations, with no prompt and no report.
//
// The guard is kept for two reasons that survive the correction. Rewriting every
// reservation is a large change to happen as a side effect of an address flag, and
// nothing in the API announces it. And the behavior is only known for a same-size
// subnet: a narrower netmask, where a host part no longer fits, is untested, as is a
// move that lands reservations inside the new DHCP pool -- which is what happened to
// 20 of those 27.
